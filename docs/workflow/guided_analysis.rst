Pre-requisites
--------------

You should first install:
* R
* git

If you have windows, you should also install:
* MobaXterm (to access unix command line)
* 7zip (to unzip tar files)


Step 1 - Setup
--------------
1.1. Open Terminal or MobaXterm

1.2. Create your project folder (if you don't already have one)::

  mkdir ~/Desktop/MyProject


1.3. go to your project folder::

  cd ~/Desktop/MyProject


1.4. Clone the repository for your single cell analysis::

  git clone https://czarnewski@bitbucket.org/scilifelab-lts/single_cell_analysis.git


1.5. Looking at directory, you should see a folder named single_cell_analysis containing the whole repository.

1.6. download the data to be used in this tutorial. We will be using data from 10X Genomics::

  https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/10x.files/samples/cell/pbmc3k/pbmc3k_filtered_gene_bc_matrices.tar.gz

You should extract the folder contents into the 'data' directory, renaming the folder for each sample number. The final folder directory should look like this.
